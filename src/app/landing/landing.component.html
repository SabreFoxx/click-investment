        *For the 10-year period ended December 31, 2020, 7 of 7 Vanguard money market funds, 67 of
        82
        Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 24 Vanguard balanced funds, and 136 of 173 Vanguard stock
        funds—for a
        total of 233 of 286 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer group averages. Results
        will
        vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with a

        **Vanguard is client-owned. As a client-owner, you own the funds that own Vanguard. The
        Where
        Investors Belong survey was conducted by market research firm Kelton Global in 2016. It
        polled
        1,000 Vanguard clients and compared them with 1,000 clients of other investment firms. All
        differences between Vanguard clients and clients of other investment firms are statistically
        significant at the 95% confidence level. The experiences of these Vanguard clients may not
        be
        representative of the experience of other Vanguard clients and aren't a guarantee of future
        investment performance or success.

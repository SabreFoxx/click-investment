            *For the 10-year period ended December 31, 2020, 7 of 7 Vanguard money market funds, 67
            of
            82
            Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 24 Vanguard balanced funds, and 136 of 173 Vanguard stock
            funds—for a
            total of 233 of 286 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer group averages.

            will
            vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with a

            Investment is client-owned. As a client-owner, you own the funds that own Vanguard. The

            Investors Belong survey was conducted by market research firm Kelton Global in 2016. It
            polled
            1,000 Vanguard clients and compared them with 1,000 clients of other investment firms.
            All
            differences between Vanguard clients and clients of other investment firms are

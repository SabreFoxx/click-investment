            *For the 10-year period ended December 31, 2020, 7 of 7 Vanguard money market funds, 67
            of
            82
            Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 24 Vanguard balanced funds, and 136 of 173 Vanguard stock
            funds—for a
            total of 233 of 286 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer group averages.
            Results
            will
            vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with a
            minimum
            10-year history were included in the comparison. Source: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters
            Company.

            Investment is client-owned. As a client-owner, you own the funds that own Vanguard. The
            Where
            Investors Belong survey was conducted by market research firm Kelton Global in 2016. It
            polled
            1,000 Vanguard clients and compared them with 1,000 clients of other investment firms.
            All
            differences between Vanguard clients and clients of other investment firms are
            statistically
            significant at the 95% confidence level. The experiences of these Vanguard clients may
